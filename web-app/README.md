# Scion Multi-Material Printer Web Interface

A modern Flask-based web application that replaces the Qt C++ GUI with a user-friendly, mobile-responsive interface focused on **sequence timing control and debugging**.

## 🎯 Focus: Sequence Timing & Control

This web interface specifically addresses the pain point of **material change sequence orchestration** - the complex timing and coordination of:

- **Drain sequence** (remove old material)
- **Fill sequence** (introduce new material)
- **Mix sequence** (optional blending)
- **Settle sequence** (stabilization time)

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔧 **Visual Sequence Control**
- Step-by-step material change visualization
- Individual timing controls for each sequence step
- Real-time progress monitoring with countdown timers
- Pause/resume/stop controls for active sequences

### ⚡ **Manual Override & Testing**
- Test individual sequence steps independently
- Manual pump controls with safety validation
- Emergency stop functionality
- Timing preset management (Fast/Normal/Thorough)

### 📊 **Real-time Process Monitoring**
- Live activity log with detailed timestamping
- Visual progress indicators for each step
- Current action and time remaining displays
- Debug-level logging controls

### 📱 **Modern Interface**
- Mobile-responsive design for tablet operation
- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Bootstrap-based professional UI
- Dark activity log for development debugging

# Run the application
python3 app.py
```

### Access the Interface

Open your browser to:
- **Local:** http://localhost:5000
- **Network:** http://[raspberry-pi-ip]:5000

## 📋 Interface Overview

### 1. **Dashboard** (`/`)

- Active recipe display with completion status
- Real-time printer status monitoring

### 2. **Recipe Builder** (`/recipe`)
- Visual form-based recipe creation
- Recipe validation and preview
- Import/export functionality
- Recipe summary statistics

### 3. **Manual Controls** (`/manual`) - **Core Feature**
- **Sequence Control Panel:** Visual timeline of material change steps
- **Timing Adjustment:** Individual controls for drain/fill/mix/settle timing
- **Step Testing:** Run individual steps for calibration
- **Process Monitor:** Real-time logging and progress tracking
- **Emergency Controls:** Safety stops and pump management
- **Debug Tools:** Connection testing and system diagnostics

## 🔧 Sequence Control Details

### Material Change Sequence

```
1. DRAIN (30s)     → Remove old material from vat
2. FILL (25s)      → Pump new material into vat
3. MIX (10s)       → Optional mixing cycle
4. SETTLE (5s)     → Allow material to stabilize
```

### Timing Controls
- **Adjustable duration** for each step (1-300 seconds)
- **Preset configurations:** Fast (60s total), Normal (70s), Thorough (90s)
- **Custom timing** with local storage persistence
- **Real-time validation** and safety limits

### Debug Features
- **Step-by-step execution** with pause capability
- **Individual step testing** for calibration
- **Detailed process logging** with timestamp correlation
- **Emergency controls** for immediate safety stops

## 🔗 Integration with Existing System

### Python Controller Integration
- Uses existing `printer_comms.py` for printer communication
- Integrates with `photonmmu_pump.py` for pump control
- Launches `print_manager.py` for automated sequences
- Preserves all current hardware communication protocols

### Configuration Compatibility
- Reads existing `network_settings.ini` for printer IP
- Uses existing `recipe.txt` format for material sequences
- Maintains compatibility with `pump_profiles.json`

### No Changes Required
- **Zero modifications** to existing Python controllers
- **Backward compatible** with current Qt GUI
- **Parallel operation** possible during development

## 🛠️ Development & Debugging

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by adding `?debug=true` to any URL:
```
http://localhost:5000/manual?debug=true
```

### Real-time Monitoring
- WebSocket connections provide live updates
- Sequence progress broadcasts to all connected clients
- Error conditions automatically displayed in interface

### Testing Individual Components
```bash
# Test printer communication
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/status

# Test pump control
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/pump \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"motor": "A", "direction": "F", "duration": 5}'

# Test emergency stop
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/emergency-stop
```

# Scion Multi-Material 3D Printer Controller - Development Roadmap

*Last Updated: August 2025*

This document outlines the current development status and remaining tasks for the multi-material printer controller. The project has undergone significant restructuring and many foundational tasks are now complete.

## Project Status Overview

âœ… **Foundation Complete** - Project restructuring, configuration management, and core architecture are implemented.
âœ… **GUI Enhancements Complete** - Advanced user interface with real-time monitoring and streamlined workflows.
âœ… **Installation & Dependencies Complete** - uart-wifi integration, modern library architecture, and legacy code cleanup.
ðŸ”§ **Active Development** - Network management, hardware control, and safety features.
ðŸ“‹ **Future Features** - Advanced analytics, remote monitoring, and smart optimization features.

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK (Phases 1, 2 & 3)

### Code Structure, Configuration & GUI Workflow
- âœ… **Clean Architecture:** Well-defined `src/`, `config/`, `tools/`, and `build/` directories.
- âœ… **Externalized Configuration:** All hardcoded paths and settings (IP addresses, pump profiles) have been moved to `.ini` and `.json` files.
- âœ… **Modular Python Code:** Core logic refactored into `printer_comms.py`, `mmu_control.py`, and `print_manager.py`.
- âœ… **Visual Recipe Editor:** A table-based UI allows for intuitive creation and management of material change recipes, eliminating manual entry errors.
- âœ… **Dynamic Status Display:** The GUI provides real-time, color-coded feedback on printer status, progress, and upcoming material changes.
- âœ… **Asynchronous Operations:** A `QThread`-based worker (`ScriptWorker`) ensures the GUI remains responsive by running all communication and hardware tasks in the background.
- âœ… **Robust Error Handling:** The system can detect and gracefully handle connection failures and hardware errors, providing clear feedback to the user.

### Installation & Architecture (Phase 3 - COMPLETE)
- âœ… **uart-wifi Dependency Integrated:** Added `uart-wifi>=0.2.1` to `requirements.txt` for reliable PyPI installation.
- âœ… **printer_comms.py Modernized:** Fully refactored to use uart-wifi library with structured responses, proper error handling, and connection management.
- âœ… **Legacy Scripts Archived:** Moved obsolete scripts (`newmonox.py`, `newcommunication.py`, `guitest.py`, `pollphoton.py`) to `src/controller/archive/` folder.
- âœ… **Clean Library Architecture:** Application now imports uart-wifi library instead of running external scripts via subprocess.
- âœ… **Installation Script Updated:** `tools/install_dependencies.sh` simplified to use standardized `requirements.txt`.

- [ ] **Document Required Hardware Configuration (I2C)**
    -   **Remaining:** Add I2C setup instructions to `README.md` installation guide.
    -   **Action:** Document the mandatory Raspberry Pi I2C interface setup for Adafruit motor controllers.

Future Enhancements (not yet implemented):
1. Introduce a simple line-based JSON protocol: each status message = one JSON object.
2. Heartbeat ping every N seconds to detect stalled processes.
3. Graceful cancellation signal via temp file or dedicated command channel.
Future Enhancement (not yet implemented): Add a `--validate-recipe` flag to `print_manager.py` to perform these checks before starting.

 - Current status polling likely parses stdout lines (e.g., JSON or key=valueâ€”formalize format in future)
 - Error handling: non-zero Python exit codes should surface a modal dialog (planned improvement if not implemented)
 - Suggested log routing (future): Write structured logs to `logs/print_manager_<timestamp>.log` while still streaming to stdout for GUI consumption.
 Planned Enhancement: Introduce a "mock printer" mode in `print_manager.py` to emulate layer advancement for local dry-runs (not yet implemented).

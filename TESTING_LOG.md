# IPC Refactor Testing Log

**Date:** 2025-01-30
**Commit:** aeb89c9 - Refactor IPC architecture: WebSocket-first with persistent print_manager service
**Tester:** Claude Code Assistant

## Testing Environment
- **Pi IP:** 10.10.36.109
- **User:** pidlp
- **Branch:** feature/webui-operational-improvements

## Test Plan
1. Pull changes on Pi and install package
2. Test print_manager as persistent service
3. Test web app WebSocket communication
4. Verify pause quiescence window functionality
5. Test end-to-end multi-material workflow

---

## Step 1: Pull Changes on Pi

**Time:** Starting test...

### Command Executed:
```bash
ssh pidlp@10.10.36.109
```

### Result:
‚úÖ **Found:** Project located at `/home/pidlp/pidlp/multi-material-printer`
- Different path than expected, but located successfully

### Pull Changes Command:
```bash
cd ~/pidlp/multi-material-printer
git pull origin feature/webui-operational-improvements
```

### Pull Result:
‚úÖ **Success:** Fast-forward update completed
- 7 files changed, 195 insertions(+), 904 deletions(-)
- CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md deleted
- setup.py created
- Major refactoring in app.py and print_manager.py applied

---

## Step 2: Install Package Dependencies

### Command Executed:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Result:
‚úÖ **Package Installation:** Successful
- scion-mmu-controller installed in editable mode

### Import Test:
```bash
python -c "from controller import print_manager, mmu_control, printer_comms; print('‚úÖ Import test passed')"
```

### Import Result:
‚úÖ **Core Imports:** Working (print_manager, mmu_control, printer_comms)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** websocket_ipc import failed (No module named 'websocket_ipc')
- This might be expected if websocket_ipc needs additional dependencies
- Will check if this affects functionality

---

## Step 3: Test print_manager as Persistent Service

### Setup Recipe File:
```bash
mkdir -p config
echo 'A,50:B,120:C,200' > config/recipe.txt
```
‚úÖ **Recipe Created:** Test recipe with 3 material changes (A@50, B@120, C@200)

### Test print_manager Startup:
```bash
python -m controller.print_manager --recipe config/recipe.txt
```

### print_manager Result:
‚úÖ **Startup:** Successful
- PrintManager initialized correctly
- Recipe loaded: 3 material changes, layer range 50-200
- IP configured: 192.168.4.6 (from network_settings.ini)
- Monitoring thread started

‚ùå **WebSocket IPC:** Not available
- Falling back to file-based communication
- websocket_ipc module import failed
- This will affect real-time communication

‚ö†Ô∏è **Printer Connection:** Disconnected
- Expected since printer may not be powered on
- print_manager continuing to monitor

### Issues Found:
1. **Missing websocket_ipc module** - Need to check why this isn't being found
2. **Printer at 192.168.4.6** - Different IP than expected (was 192.168.4.3)

---

## Step 4: Test Web App WebSocket Communication

### Starting Web App:
```bash
cd web-app
python app.py
```

### Web App Result:
‚úÖ **Startup:** Successful
- Controllers available: True
- Config path: /home/pidlp/pidlp/multi-material-printer/config
- Recipe path found
- Logging integration enabled
- Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
- WebSocket connections being accepted

‚úÖ **Key Improvements Working:**
- "Expecting external persistent print_manager service (no auto-spawn)" message confirms subprocess removal
- WebSocket-based IPC system active
- No more auto-spawning print_manager

### WebSocket Import Investigation:
- websocket_ipc.py exists at ./src/controller/websocket_ipc.py
- Direct import test: ‚úÖ Works when called directly
- Issue might be in print_manager context vs direct Python execution

---

## Step 5: Test print_manager + Web App Connection

### Connecting print_manager to running web app:

**Initial Attempt:**
‚ùå **WebSocket IPC Issue:** "websocket_ipc not available - falling back to file-based communication"

**Root Cause Found:**
- Import error in print_manager.py: `from websocket_ipc import WebSocketIPCClient`
- Should be `from .websocket_ipc import WebSocketIPCClient` (relative import)
- Fixed import path with fallback strategy

**Fix Applied:**
```bash
# Fixed import in print_manager.py and pushed changes
git pull origin feature/webui-operational-improvements
```

**Fixed Test Result:**
‚úÖ **WebSocket IPC:** Working!
- "WebSocket IPC client initialized"
- "Connecting to SocketIO server at http://localhost:5000"
- "Connected to SocketIO server"
- "Connected to web application via WebSocket"
- "WebSocket connection established"

### Connection Success Messages:
```
Initializing PrintManager...
WebSocket IPC client initialized
Multi-Material Printer Ready - IP: 192.168.4.6
Connecting to SocketIO server at http://localhost:5000
Connected to SocketIO server
Connected to web application via WebSocket
WebSocket connection established
```

---

## Step 6: Test Web UI Status Indicators

### Testing Web App + print_manager Connection:

**Background Shell Setup:**
- Web app: Background shell d0a921 running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
- print_manager: Background shell 8e7590 connecting to web app

**Connection Test Results:**
‚úÖ **WebSocket IPC:** Fully functional!
- print_manager: "Connected to SocketIO server"
- print_manager: "Connected to web application via WebSocket"
- print_manager: "WebSocket connection established"

**API Command Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"motor": "A", "direction": "F", "duration": 3}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/pump
```

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "command_id": "web_1759177003_2",
  "message": "Pump A command sent (F for 3s)",
  "success": true
}
```

**print_manager Command Execution:**
```
Received WebSocket command: pump_control (web_1759177003_2)
[PUMP] Executing manual pump command: A F for 3s
Running Pump A: 3s
Pump Pump A completed
[PUMP] Manual pump A F 3s: success
```

‚úÖ **End-to-End Flow Working Perfectly:**
1. API request ‚Üí Web app
2. Web app ‚Üí WebSocket command to print_manager
3. print_manager ‚Üí Hardware execution
4. Hardware ‚Üí Success response back through chain

---

## Step 7: Test Pause Quiescence Window

**Critical Test:** Verify 10-second quiescence window prevents printer command conflicts

### Testing Pause Command:

**Pause API Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/printer/pause
```
**Result:** ‚ùå `{"message": "Print manager not connected", "success": false}`

**Material Change Sequence Test:**
```bash
curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"target_material": "B", "config": {"drain_time": 5, "fill_time": 5, "mix_time": 2, "settle_time": 2}}' \
  http://localhost:5000/api/sequence/material-change
```
**Result:** ‚úÖ `{"message": "Material change sequence to B started via WebSocket", "success": true}`

**Issue Identified:**
- Some API endpoints (pause, multi-material/start) report "Print manager not connected"
- Other endpoints (pump, material-change sequence) work correctly
- This suggests inconsistent WebSocket connection detection between endpoints
- The pump API uses `send_command_to_print_manager()` which works
- Other APIs might be using different connection checking logic

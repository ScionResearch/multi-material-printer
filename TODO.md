# Multi-Material Printer Controller - Critical Issues TODO

*Created: September 25, 2025*


## ‚úÖ FIXES APPLIED - SEPTEMBER 25, 2025

### Pause/Resume Sequence Logic (FIXED)
- [x] **Fixed bed positioning during material changes**
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced material change sequence with clear step logging
  - ‚úÖ Extended bed rise wait time from 3 to 5 seconds
  - ‚úÖ Added step-by-step progress logging for better debugging
  - ‚úÖ Current: Pause ‚Üí Wait for bed rise ‚Üí Run pumps ‚Üí Resume
  - Location: `print_manager.py:357-387` - `_handle_material_change()` method

### Command Recognition Errors (FIXED)
- [x] **Fixed "goresume" command error handling**
  - ‚úÖ Added better error detection for "unrecognized command" responses
  - ‚úÖ Still returns success if response contains "OK" even with error message
  - ‚úÖ Confirmed `goresume` is correct command per uart-wifi documentation
  - ‚úÖ Added detailed error logging for debugging
  - Location: `printer_comms.py:160-177` - `resume_print()` method

### GUI Issues (FIXED)
- [x] **Fixed stop printer popup display**
  - ‚úÖ Added proper message content when response is empty
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced popup titles and error messages
  - ‚úÖ Added structured logging to text browser
  - ‚úÖ Now shows "Stop command sent successfully" for empty responses
  - Location: `dialog.cpp:221-237` - `on_stopPr_clicked()` method

### Print Manager Exit Error (FIXED)
- [x] **Fixed print manager error exit code handling**
  - ‚úÖ Added proper return values to `start_monitoring()` method
  - ‚úÖ Implemented clean exit codes (0 = success, 1 = error)
  - ‚úÖ Added success/error messages for clearer feedback
  - ‚úÖ Should eliminate mysterious exit code 15 errors
  - Location: `print_manager.py:487-498` - `main()` function

## üîç ACTIVE ISSUES - September 26, 2025

### GUI Enhancement & Logging Issues
- [ ] **Improve GUI logging for better troubleshooting**
  - Need real-time pump status visibility in GUI output
  - Replace annoying *** command sections with cleaner formatting
  - Add better visual separation of log sections
  - Show pump operations (drain/fill) in GUI output stream

- [ ] **Fix goresume command error (continues to work despite error)**
  - "ERROR: unrecognized command: goresume" followed by "goresume,OK"
  - Command works but shows confusing error - investigate timing or protocol issue
  - May be related to printer pause/resume bed positioning problems

- [ ] **Bed positioning during material changes**
  - Bed stays down during pause (normally raises in standard prints)
  - Drain pump runs with bed down
  - Fill pump runs with bed down
  - Bed finally rises while pump still running (printer still paused)
  - Print resumes after pump finishes - sequence seems wrong

- [ ] **Add automatic status polling to GUI**
  - Eliminate need to manually click "Check Status" repeatedly
  - Show short status updates every few seconds during printing
  - Don't need full status dump - just key info (layer, status, progress)

### Investigation Tasks
- [x] **Analyze print manager logs for error patterns**
  - ‚úÖ Reviewed complete log output for error sequence
  - ‚úÖ Identified exit code 15 caused by unhandled exceptions in main()
  - ‚úÖ Added proper exception handling and return codes

### Command Protocol Review
- [x] **Verify printer communication protocol**
  - ‚úÖ Confirmed "goresume" is correct per uart-wifi library documentation
  - ‚úÖ Reviewed printer firmware documentation in anycubic_python_uart_wifi.md
  - ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling instead of changing commands

## üß™ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

### Workflow Testing
- [ ] **Test complete print workflow end-to-end**
  1. Connect to printer status
  2. Get files list
  3. Start MMU controller
  4. Begin print with material changes
  5. Verify proper pause/resume sequence
  6. Test stop functionality

### Material Change Testing
- [ ] **Validate material change sequence**
  - Monitor bed position during material changes
  - Verify pump operation timing
  - Confirm proper resume after material change

## üìã COMPLETION CRITERIA

- [ ] **GUI Improvements:**
  - [ ] Real-time pump status visible in GUI output
  - [ ] Clean log formatting (no *** sections)
  - [ ] Automatic status polling every few seconds
  - [ ] Short status display (layer, status, progress only)

- [ ] **Print Process:**
  - [ ] Material changes execute with proper bed positioning
  - [ ] Bed raises immediately on pause (before pump operations)
  - [ ] Pump sequence runs with bed in raised position
  - [ ] Print resumes cleanly after material change

- [ ] **Error Resolution:**
  - [ ] No "unrecognized command: goresume" errors
  - [ ] Print manager exits cleanly (exit code 0)
  - [ ] Complete print workflow functions without errors

## üîß TECHNICAL NOTES



**Error Pattern:**
```
ERROR: unrecognized command: goresume
goresume,OK
(repeated 3 times)
```

**Exit Status:**
```
=== PRINT MANAGER FINISHED ===
Exit code: 15
Print manager exited with error
```

# Scion Multi-Material 3D Printer Controller - Development Roadmap

*Last Updated: August 2025*

This document outlines the current development status and remaining tasks for the multi-material printer controller. The project has undergone significant restructuring and many foundational tasks are now complete.

## Project Status Overview

âœ… **Foundation Complete** - Project restructuring, configuration management, and core architecture are implemented  
ðŸ”§ **Active Development** - GUI enhancements and user workflow improvements  
ðŸ“‹ **Future Features** - Advanced functionality and optimization  

---

## âœ… COMPLETED WORK (Phase 1 - Foundation)

### Code Structure & Organization
- âœ… **Directory Structure** - Clean `src/`, `config/`, `tools/`, `build/` organization
- âœ… **File Migration** - All source files moved to appropriate locations
- âœ… **Build System** - Updated Qt project files (`ScionMMUController.pro`)
- âœ… **Git Configuration** - `.gitignore` file created and configured
- âœ… **Python Module Structure** - Created `__init__.py` and proper package structure

### Configuration Management  
- âœ… **ConfigManager Class** - Dynamic configuration loading from INI files
- âœ… **Network Settings** - `network_settings.ini.template` for IP configuration
- âœ… **Pump Profiles** - `pump_profiles.json` for hardware settings
- âœ… **Path Resolution** - Eliminated all hardcoded paths

### Python Module Refactoring
- âœ… **printer_comms.py** - Clean interface for printer communication
- âœ… **mmu_control.py** - Multi-material unit control wrapper
- âœ… **print_manager.py** - Print orchestration module

### Bug Fixes
- âœ… **Script Path Issues** - Fixed hardcoded `/home/pidlp/pidlp/dev/scripts/` references
- âœ… **IP Address Configuration** - Removed hardcoded `192.168.4.2` references
- âœ… **Shell Script Errors** - Fixed typos in network management scripts
